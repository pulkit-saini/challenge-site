         <h4>Duration: 15th Nov 2024 to 1st Jan 2025</h4>

         <div id="rules">
          <h5>Objective :</h5>
           <p>Stay focused, reduce distractions, and improve daily productivity.
            Keep your scores as low as possible and build better habits!
           </p>

          <h5>How it Works:</h5>
          <ul>
          <li>Each day, participants track their screen time and to-do list completion.</li>
          <li>A 0 means you successfully met the goal, and a 1 means you didn't.</li>
          <li>Penalties are applied based on incomplete tasks and exceeding the screen time limit.</li>

          </ul>
          <h5>Rules:</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>Daily Screen Time: Your total mobile screen time must be less than 5 hours each day.</li>
            <li>Daily To-Do List: Complete all the tasks on your to-do list, prepared the night before.</li>

          </ol>
          <h5>Scoring System:</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If you complete both tasks (screen time < 5 hours and finish your to-do list), you score 0 for the day.</li>
            <li>If you fail any one or both tasks, you score 1 for the day.</li>
          </ul>
 
            <h5>Penalty:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>At the end of the challenge (1st January 2025), the person with the highest total score will have to pay ₹200 to the participant with the next lower score.</li>
              <li>If you fail to keep your screen time under 5 hours, you must pay ₹5 for exceeding the limit.</li>
              <li>For every incomplete task on your to-do list, you must pay ₹5 per task at the end of the day.</li>

            </ul>
            <h5>Weekly Off:</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Each participant gets 1 day off per week, which can be chosen as per their preference.</li>
              <li>If the weekly off is not used, it will roll over to the next week as an additional off.</li>
            </ul>
